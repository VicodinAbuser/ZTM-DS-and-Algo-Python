#Although arrays are pre-defined in Python in the form of lists, we can implement our own arrays.
#Here, we will implement our own array with some common methods such as access, push, pop, insert, delete

    #The attributes of the array class are stored in a dictionary by default.
    #When the __dict__ method is called on an instance of the class it returns the attributes of the class along with their values in a dictionary format
    #Now, when the instance of the class is printed, it returns a class object with its location in memory.
    #But we know when we print the array we get the elements of the array as output
    #When we print the instance of the class, the built-in __str__ method is called. So we can modify the __str__ method inside the class
    #To suit our needs.
